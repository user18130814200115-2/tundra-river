# tundra-river
dotfiles for my config using the riven wayland compositor themed according to my tundra theme

## GTK

Designed for use with Nordic-darker

## Software

The software required is:
- river
- foot
- yambar

Keep in mind that the entire config uses a lot of custom software such as my
own web browser Cgull and various scripts. These scripts all have their own
dependencies, so check the source code for them.
